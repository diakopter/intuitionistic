REQUIREMENTS:

- Ocaml v4.00 or later (tested with Ocaml 4.01).

- LLVM 3.4.1, installed with OCaml bindings. Easiest way to get
  these is to build LLVM from source (after having installed OCaml).


INSTALLATION:

Type 'make' in the IPL main folder.

The default IPL Makefile target creates the following binaries.
./iplc      The iplc compiler.
./iplc.opt  An optimized version of the iplc compiler.
./ipltop    An Ocaml toplevel with IPL preloaded.
